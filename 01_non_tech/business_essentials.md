## Fixed-price & T&M (Time and Material)
Fixed-price agreement:
- single-sum contract where a service provider is accountable for completing the project within the agreed sum set out in the bond.

### When to use a fixed price contract:
  - Clear requirements and determined deadlines;
  - Limited or fixed budget;
  - Small projects with the limited project scope.

Time and material (T&M) contract:
  - Customers are charged for the amount of hours spent on a specific project, plus costs of materials. 
  - The main advantage of T&M model is flexibility and opportunity to adjust requirements, shift directions, replace features, and involve users to get the very product.

### When to use T&M price contract:
  - Long-term projects with dynamic requirements;
  - Project scope is not yet fully known;
  - You want the flexibility to modify the scope or vary the workloads.
